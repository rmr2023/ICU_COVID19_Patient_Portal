# PACRR1_COVID19_Patient_Portal

Health Portal for ICU Hospitalized COVID19 Patients
Objective
Through using the Post-Acute Covid-19 Patients Rehab and Recovery Patients Portal (PACRR), patients who recently received care in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and/or long hospitalization can manage their health and monitor their progress in a holistic and centralized way. Specifically, these patients can:
•	Track their many doctor and therapist appointments to treat medical diagnoses from pre-existing medical conditions as well as medical and mental conditions resulting from Covid-19.
•	Track their many medications prescribed by various doctors.
•	Identify local wellness and rehab and recovery programs to improve their mental well-being.
•	Identify exercise and diet plans that supplement the recovery and rehabilitation.
Abstract
PACRR is a proof-of-concept health IT application that is to help post-acute Covid-19 patients manage their health appointments and medications and monitor their health goals all in a centralized portal. 

Patients who recently received care in the ICU for COVID-19 treatments are subject to a higher risk of lingering mental illness, cognitive-behavioral disorders, and challenging physical recovery. The many sources of distress, coming from the patients’ physical pain, weaknesses, the emotional trauma from a long period of isolation in hospital, job loss, and  financial difficulties will make the patient’s post Covid-19 recovery care particularly complex and devastating. 

The traditional way of having patients schedule appointments with many different doctors and therapists is scattered and difficult to monitor progress. PACRR is a health portal that also would help patients identify focused health information, recommend public resources for self-help and wellbeing, specific to the neighborhood of the patients.
